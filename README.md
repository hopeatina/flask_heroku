Percey is a Slack bot + Web App

Percey works to understand your slack group's communication, create a graph model of it, 
and suggest connections to improve the quality of your network.

This library also include a simulator.py. Which uses the current state of 
your network as a starting point for predicting optimal interventions and 
connections.

Hope 2016
